If you believe you've found a security issue in the addy.io product or service, I encourage you to
notify me. I welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly. Thanks in advance!

# Disclosure Policy

  effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide me with a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a
  third-party. I may publicly disclose the issue before resolving it, if appropriate.
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or
  degradation of the service. Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the
  account holder.
