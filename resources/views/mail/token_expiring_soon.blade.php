# Your API key expires soon

One of the API keys on your addy.io account will expire in **one weeks time**.

If you are not using this API key for the browser extensions, mobile apps or to access the API then you do not need to take any action.

If you **are using the key** for the any of the above then please log into your account and generate a new API key to replace this one before your current one expires.

Once an API key has expired it can no longer be used to access the API.
